            A Tense and Satisfying Game for Farmers, Maltsters and Grain
            Traders!
          </h2>
          <p>
            Bust That Bug is a game of skill and aggression that lets you pit
            your wits against those pesky grain store pests!
          </p>
          <p>
            The game is set inside a grain store. If you watch the grain
            carefully you will see bugs emerging slowly from the grain. Click
            your mouse to zap as many bugs as you can before they disappear back
            into the grain. Each round lasts 20 seconds.
          </p>
          <p>
            But beware - The bugs don't stay for long, and once they're gone
            they're gone!
