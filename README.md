# Bug Buster - A Game for Grain Traders, Farmers and Maltsters

Bug Buster is a self-directed project to practise MERN full-stack skills by means of a computer game where the player scores points by clicking on bugs which appear and disappear rapidly and randomly against an intricate background.

## User Stories

- As a user I want to be able to score points by clicking on them as they appear and before they disappear.
- As a user I want to be able to keep count of the number of bugs I have zapped in a session.
- As a user I want to be able to select from 3 difficulty levels.
- As a user I want the data from each session to persist so I can retrieve previous scores from the database.

### Stretch Goals

- As a user I want the bugs to "explode" when they are clicked.
- As a user I want my scores to be kept separately from other players' scores and accessed using a log-in.

## Project Structure

- On opening the game the user has the choice of playing a single game without logging in, or logging in using Auth0 so their scores can be stored in the database and retrieved.
